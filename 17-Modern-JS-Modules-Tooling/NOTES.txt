## Modules

    > Re-usable code
    > Usually a stand alone file
        why:
        Abstracted code
        Organised code 
        Reuse code

    ES6 Modules
        Exports
        Imports
            Need to happen at top level
            Imports are hoisted! NO Matter where you are importing, it's like code is moved to the top of file, It's the 1st thing that happens in a module.
        HTML Linking <script type="module" src="script.js"></script>
        Can only import/export outside of a block... top level
        Exporting = Async
        Importing = Sync
        Values are refernced.. as if they were actually there. So they will change if manipulated
        They get executed first after being parsed and linked

CLEAN CODE
    Pass in the data to functions to return new data - do not mutatate outside data, don't rely on the scope chain
